Read the install instructions on the torch5 site http://torch5.sourceforge.net/manual/Install-2.html

Not an easy package to install, but nice once it is.



Torch5 Library.
===============

Torch5 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient
implementation, thanks to an easy and fast scripting language (Lua) and a
underlying C implementation.
